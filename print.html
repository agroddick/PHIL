      </li>
      <li>The audio playback on the headset may be delayed from that on the transmitting device, due to the characteristics of Bluetooth wireless technology. As a result, the sound may not be in sync with the image when viewing movies or playing games. </li>
      <li>The headset supports security functions that comply with the <span class="uicontrol">Bluetooth</span> standard as a means of ensuring security during communication using <span class="uicontrol">Bluetooth</span> wireless technology. However, depending on the configured settings and other factors, this security may not be sufficient. Be careful when communicating using <span class="uicontrol">Bluetooth</span> wireless technology. </li>
      <li>Sony shall assume no responsibility for any damages or loss resulting from information leaks that occur when using <span class="uicontrol">Bluetooth</span> communications. </li>

    <h3>To protect the headset and charging case from being damaged </h3>
    <p>Carefully note the precautions below to ensure proper use of the headset. </p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>Do not splash water forcibly into the sound output part or microphone of the headset. </li>
      <li>Do not allow the headset to remain wet in a cold environment, as the water may freeze. To prevent malfunction, make sure to wipe off any water after use. </li>
      <li>Do not place the headset in water or use it in a humid place such as a bathroom. </li>
      <li>Do not drop the headset or expose it to mechanical shock. Doing so may deform or damage the headset, resulting in deterioration of water resistance performance. </li>
      <li>If the headset gets wet, 
        <ol class="list">
          <li><p>Use a soft dry cloth to wipe off any water that gets on the headset. </p></li>

          <li><p>After completing these steps, leave the headset to dry in room temperature. </p></li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>If the headset units and charging case are charged while they are wet with sweat, etc., the charging ports will corrode. Before charging, wipe off any moisture with a soft dry cloth and leave to dry in room temperature. <br /> Repairs in case of a malfunction without care are not covered by the free warranty.

      </li>
      <li>When the charging ports of the headset or charging case get dirty, wipe them clean with a soft dry cloth. </li>
      <li>Do not wash pants or shirts with the headset units left in the pockets.
